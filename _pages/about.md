My field of research is mathematical biology, and I am primarily interested in simulating, modeling, and analyzing mechanistic mathematical models of neurological and physiological phenomena. In particular, I develop and use tools in dynamical systems, statistical physics, and stochastic processes to understand how polymerization impacts physiological processes like blood clot formation and neuronal injury. I am a Phillip Griffiths Assistant Research Professor in the [Department of Mathematics](https://math.duke.edu/ "Department of Mathematics") at Duke University, where I am working with [Veronica Ciocanel](https://services.math.duke.edu/~ciocanel/ "Veronica Ciocanel").

Prior to Duke, I completed my Ph.D. in mathematics in the [Department of Mathematics](https://math.utah.edu "Department of Mathematics") at the University of Utah under the supervision of [Aaron L. Fogelson](https://math.utah.edu/~fogelson "Aaron L. Fogelson" ). 

Outside of mathematics, I enjoy [disc golf](https://www.pdga.com/player/149354), hiking, baking, traveling, and playing/directing [handbells](/assets/pdf/MathematicsOfBellRinging_2020Talk.pdf).
