Since Fall 2021, I am a William W. Elliott Assistant Research Professor in the [Department of Mathematics](https://math.duke.edu/ "Department of Mathematics") at Duke University, where I am working with [Veronica Ciocanel](https://services.math.duke.edu/~ciocanel/ "Veronica Ciocanel"). My field of research is mathematical biology, and I am primarily interested in simulating, modeling, and analyzing aggregation and polymerization processes in cellular physiology. My research interests include dynamical systems, mathematical modeling, and stochastic processes.
