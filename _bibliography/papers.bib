abstract = {Microtubules (MTs) are dynamic protein filaments essential for intracellular organization and transport, particularly in long-lived cells such as neurons. The plus and minus ends of neuronal MTs switch between growth and shrinking phases, and the nucleation of new filaments is believed to be regulated in both healthy and injury conditions. We propose stochastic and deterministic mathematical models to investigate the impact of filament nucleation and length-regulation mechanisms on emergent properties such as MT lengths and numbers in living cells. We expand our stochastic continuous-time Markov chain model of filament dynamics to incorporate MT nucleation and capture realistic stochastic fluctuations in MT numbers and tubulin availability. We also propose a simplified partial differential equation (PDE) model, which allows for tractable analytical investigation into steady-state MT distributions under different nucleation and length-regulating mechanisms. We find that the stochastic and PDE modeling approaches show good agreement in MT length distributions, and that both MT nucleation and the catastrophe rate of large-length MTs regulate MT length distributions. In both frameworks, multiple mechanistic combinations achieve the same average MT length. The models proposed can predict parameter regimes where the system is scarce in tubulin, the building block of MTs, and suggest that low filament nucleation regimes are characterized by high variation in MT lengths, while high nucleation regimes drive high variation in MT numbers. These mathematical frameworks have the potential to improve our understanding of MT regulation in both healthy and injured neurons.}
